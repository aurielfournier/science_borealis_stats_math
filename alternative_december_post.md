# Why is there error in statistics?

## By: Auriel M.V. Fournier

One common misconception of statistics is that we can make precise predictions and that once we do that is how that event will happen. There are exceptions of this, of course, but most times in statistics there is error associated with a prediction. That is there some range of values where we predict something may occur. 

For instance we predict a given city in Quebec will receive 100 cm of snow this year plus or minus 20 cm. This means that we predict that city will receive between 80 and 120 cm of snow. When we are talking about something like weather prediction this uncertainty in our prediction might make a lot of sense. We all know how variable weather can be, I grew up around the Great Lakes and the weather can change at the drop of a hat. When we start to predict other things the error can sometimes cause unease. 

Error can be very frustrating both for those doing the predictions and for those trying to use them. If the error is too large it can make the prediction less informative, or totally useless. Because of this statisticians often try to reduce the error as much as possible by trying to understand what is driving the process they are modeling. 

Take climate change for instance, there are many possible scenarios under which climate change is currently being predicted, different levels of CO2 and other gases which impact climate. There are different scenarios of countries implementing policies and over different time scales. And there is uncertainty in how things will change in the future. Many of these models assume that change will continue in the way it has in the past, where as others thing we could hit a point where things begin to accelerate much faster. 

The number of predictions about climate change cause some people to have doubts about the validity of climate change as a phenomenon. I am not qualified to go through all the details of why climate change is a big deal, but it is, and the diversity of models predicting what could happen in the future are important, but all have their own sources of error. 

The error in these models, like many models, is because there is always something in the system that we cannot account for. Most systems are incredibly complex, especially when we talk about natural systems, like climate. With our current computing and mathematical abilities we cannot take into account everything, we just cannot do it, so we will always have models with uncertainty, with weaknesses, with flaws, and that is OK. 

As George E.P. Box said

> "Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful" [Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces (1987)](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box)

While we know that there are errors in our climate change models, just like we know there are errors in our models that predict our daily weather, the outcomes of elections, stock markets, advertising, when birds migrate, when traffic will be bad during your morning commute, who will win a sporting event we can still use them to make informed guesses and make decisions about our lives. Using statistical models driven by data to help inform our decisions can be one way of removing human bias from the process. Expert opinion is a valuable tool, but expert opinion paired with data driven predictions helps remove expert bias and make the process of decision making more transparent. 

While error can make using predictions more challenging it is an inevitable part of the process and trying to understand what is causing the error can help us better understand the phenomenon we are interested in. In my own work trying to understand what habitats rails use during the fall our initial analysis had huge error, and this lead us to explore other ways of collecting habitat data so we could find variables which explain the data better. Error can be frustrating, but understanding error is key to the correct interpretation of statistics and understanding the world around us.
