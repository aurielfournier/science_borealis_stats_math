# evaluating risk : why bacon is not going to kill you
(not sold on this title, but its a title)
By: Andrew MacDonald and Auriel Fournier


Most of us hear statistics on a daily basis, be it a weather prediction (30% chance of rain) or a new study on the health risks of coffee or bacon (it really does cause cancer thsi time!). In both these cases we are provided with soem numbers, and those numbers are often surroudned by catchy writing that doesn't actually interpret the numbers as a statistic. 

Humans are pretty bad at evaluating risk as it is anyway, much less when we don't know how to interpret the data that is set before us. 

So lets start with something that is relatively low risk, the weather. You hear the forecast on the radio and it says there is a 30% chance of rain today. What does that actually mean, should you prepare for rain?  should you close your bedroom window? The answer to those last two questions is more objective, but what 30% chance means is that there is a 1 in 3 chance that at some point during the day it will rain. That does not mean it will rain 30% of the time. It could rain all day in fact and still meat the criteria of 30% chance. It could also not rain, at all, and the forecast is still accurate. But in an insance like possibly getting rained on this might not really be a high stakes moment. 

What if you are trying to understand the risks involved with consuming a certain kind of food, or the risks associated with a certain kind of medical treatment, these could be more more serious decisions and understanding the math is important.

[risk of flying vs risk of driving your car]


What is an acceptable level of risk?

That, is not a mathematical question sadly. While mathematics and statistics can help us understand the risks associated with different decisions they cannot make those decisions for us, we have to decide what level of risk we are ok with. 30% chance of rain, sure, I'll risk it and not take my raincoat. 30% chance of the surgery killing me, I'll think about it longer then I did the rain coat, thats for sure.
