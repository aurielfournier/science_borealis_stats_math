# World Wetlands Day History Lesson: Waterfowl and statistics

By: Auriel Fournier

Its World Wetlands Day, and while I spend most of all of my days thinking about wetlands and the birds that live within them, I realize most people don't. But today we are going to dive into the two things that I think are oftn misunderstood about wetlands. The role that hunting and statistics have played in wetland conservation in North America. Wetlands are so important, and one of the reasons that we have many of them that we do today in North America is because of hunting, because of statistics, because of people who care, a lot, about migratory birds. So birds, wetlands, hunting, statistics, all my favorite things. This is gonna be great!

Waterfowl include many species of ducks and geese and swans. These are typically large migratory birds, many of which are also game species. For many decades researchers in Canada and the U.S. have ben banding waterfowl during the breeding season to study their migration. They do this because some of these banded birds will be harvested, and when they are, the hunters will hopefully report the band number, and where they killed it. This helps us to understand how birds move at a continental level. For non-game species the recapture rate (the rate at which birds which are banded are encountered for a second time) is very low, like less then one percent low.

There are many arguments against hunting, which I completely understand and respect, but hunting gives us a unique way of increasing that rate. Hunting has provided valuable informatino for decades, so lets combine the two and dive into how a number cruncher and a hunter are important parts of the same process of managing and understanding our ecological systems. 

First lets identify the problem, if we are going to conserve and manage a population we need to know how many are in that population and what their demographics are. There are several ways to do this, ideally we would census the population, which even with human populations in developed countries is very very challenging to accomplish, so in wildlife, unless we are dealing with a very small population, we don't census, we sample, and we infer from there. There are many ways we can sample and study, depending on our goals, budgets, the organism we are studying.

We can use statistical models called 'known fate' to model the population. These models allow us to incorporate these records from the ends of individuals lives, and also incorporates information from birds which are recaptured each year alive. We can understand how long individuals live, where they go, and how these variables change for different parts of the population (do males or females live longer?, what about different ages?).

These kinds of studies can be done at the local scale. For instance, the past few months I've been working with Canada Goose data looking at the population of resident Canada Geese in Arkansas. We have banding data for 10 years from several locations across the state, we also have recapture information (birds who were banded one year and captured the next year), and data from hunted birds from across the state. We can use this data to estimate the size of the resident Canada goose population in Arkansas (resident Canada geese are geese who do not migrate, [[difference between resident and migratory geese](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/canada-goose-resident-vs-migratory/)].     

When you apply these methods at the continental scale you get the methods of how we have flyways, how we determine bag limits and hunting seasons, and how we think about bird migration. Back in the (decades) waterfowl populations were low, we started 

Wetlands were lost at a huge rate (~70% in settled areas of Canada, similar rates across much of the U.S.) which makes the conservation of the ones we do have really important. Many people cared about this, and one big player was the hunting community and also the conservation community (which are not mutually exclusive groups, even though some members of both try to be all exclusive).
