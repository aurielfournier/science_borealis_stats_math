## Science Borealis Post September 2015

There was a time in my (Auriel's) life, well really there was this entire beginning part of my life, where I hated math. I didn't think it was worthwhile, I wanted to study birds and in my mind that meant I didn't need math. I didn't think I would ever use it and I graduated high school planning to move past this whole math thing and study wildlife ecology. 

The problem is, my mother was right (_again_), and math is super useful. But it took me till I was in graduate school to really understand why and to embrace statistics as something I wanted to learn more about on my own.

In my first year of graduate school I attended a week long statistics workshop on occupancy modeling, and I was sitting there listening to someone with a PhD in Statistics talk about Statistics and I loved it. That was when it really hit me that my outlook on math and statisics had taken a drastic turn. 

Statistics were really useful (espcially when you can stop doing them by hand) and I was hooked. 18 year old me would laugh, long and hard, at this idea, but statistics and I now spend part of most working days together analyzing data, writing code, or working on other parts of the data crunching process. 

Currently I spend quite a bit of time doing hierarchical modeling with an R package 'unmarked'. These models allow us to take survey data of birds (in my case these awesome wetland birds called rails) and model both abundance (our end goal) and detection probability (the probability of detecting a bird, given that it is present) which provides more accurate measures of abundance in relation to different variables (like water depth in the wetland, or observer performing the survey).

This allows us understand how wetland management impacts fall migration of rails. It allows us to compare how densities of rails change over the season to understand the timing of their migration and to compare the differences in timing between years. 

I do all of my statistics in R, which is a statistical programming language that can be used for a wide variety of types of statistical tests and modeling. You can also use it for data management, cleaning, manipulation, programming and other tasks. It is one of many languages, within wildlife ecology R one of the most widely used, but many fields of science use different languages.

The most recent step in my continuing journey with statistics was deciding to pursue a Masters in Statistics and Analytics along with my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology during my time here at the University of Arkansas. My PhD was extended a year because of some additional funding (yah!) which opened up some time for me to take a few extra courses. I am very pumped to share what I learn over the next two years about statistics with all of you and help you understand why statistics are so useful, why they are important for everyone, and what is currently going on in the world of math.

## Andrew's words

I first saw real quantitative ecology in a small shack, on a deserted island hidden in the Atlantic fog.

I was an undergraduate, and this was my first real field course: two weeks on Bon Portage Island, off the coast of Nova Scotia. As in all field courses, we did lots of group fieldwork -- counting periwinkles and _Fucus_ sp., counting birds, measuring plants. As we were preparing our final projects, Professor Dave Shutler sat in a small shed behind the main classroom. Each group would troop down the hill to where he sat in the fog, and read out the data from our smudged yellow Write-in-the-Rain notebooks. He'd type the numbers in, hit a few buttons, and run something called a "GLM".

For the first time, stastics wasn't some vague, plodding subject about flipping coins. Statistics was deeply connected to the animals, plants and environment of this small island.
