## Science Borealis Post September 2015

There was a time in Auriel's life, well really there was this entire beginning part of her life, where she hated math. She didn't think it was worthwhile, She wanted to study birds and in her mind that meant she didn't need math. Auriel didn't think she would ever use it and she graduated high school planning to move past this whole math thing and study wildlife ecology. The problem is, her mother was right (_again_), and math is super useful. But it took her till graduate school to really understand why and to embrace statistics. Statistics are really useful (espcially when you can stop doing them by hand). 18-year-old Auriel would laugh, long and hard, at this idea, but she and statistics now spend part of most working days together analyzing data, writing code, or working on other parts of the data crunching process. 

Andrew first saw real quantitative ecology in a small shack, on a deserted island hidden in the Atlantic fog. He was an undergraduate, and this was his first real field course: two weeks on [Bon Portage Island](http://www.acadiau.ca/~dshutler/PIsland.html), off the coast of Nova Scotia. As in all field courses, there was lots of group fieldwork -- counting periwinkles and _Fucus_ sp., counting birds, measuring plants. Finally, each group would troop down the hill to where Professor Dave Shutler sat shrouded in fog in a small shed. He'd type the numbers in, hit a few buttons, and run something called a "GLM" (a Generalized Linear Model). Statistics was transformed from some plodding subject about flipping coins, into a subject deeply connected to the animals, plants and environment of this small island. At the same time it was still very mysterious, Andrew's knowledge of it was small and indistinct as that tiny island in the Atlantic fog. Then, during his Masters, he met a tropical ecologist named Cam Webb, who introduced him to something called "R". R is a programming language that specializes in working with data and statistics. Andrew loved it. It's an excellent tool for a field ecologist (or any scientist): freely available, flexible, and with a huge community to help a beginner learn. 

Currently Auriel spends her time using models to understand bird migration. These models allow us to take survey data of birds (in my case these awesome wetland birds called rails) and model both abundance which provides more accurate measures of abundance in relation to different variables (like water depth in the wetland). The results of these models will be used to inform management of wetlands for rails and other species (so we'll know how deep to flood wetlands for rails, and what kind of plants they like). Models like these are used by non-profit, provincial and federal organizations to answer questions about how to manage habitat, allocate money for conservation planning and understand what might happen to a species in the future. 

Right now Andrew is studying the community of invertebrates that lives inside plants called bromeliads. Bromeliads are found all throughout the Neotropics. The collect rainwater in their leaves, and lots of small flies, beetles and damselflies live in these tiny pools of water. They're really great for studying ecology in small, discrete habitats. To understand them, Andrew spends a lot of time in R doing multivariate statistics, generalized linear models (no longer _completely_ mysterious!) and randomization tests. The latter is an important way to think about patterns we see in ecological communities. For example, if you find that some species are only found in large habitats, does that mean that they actually *prefer* large habitats? It could be because larger habitats have more individual animals, and therefore a bigger chance of containing any specific species. Randomization tests let you ask what patterns you would see in your data if there were "no biology" -- in this case, no preference for bromeliads of a different size!

While both Auriel and Andrew study ecological systems, statistics and mathematics have wide ranging implications in many fields, from physics to engineering to economics to politics. While advanced statistics can be very complex understanding how statistics works, and how to interpret the results of simple models and tests is vital to interpreting the world around us, to assessing risk, to understanding that there is natural variation in most things and so a small rise or fall in something might not be cause for alarm. Understanding statistics can help you make informed decisions about things in your daily life, help you have an informed opinion about policies, laws and ideas. Andrew and Auriel's goal is to help clear the fog from statistics and make it more accessible while also revealing how fun and rewarding a career involving math and statistics can be.
